## Gesture Recognition
 Employ computer vision and machine learning techniques to recognize and
interpret human gestures.
 Collect and preprocess gesture data, which may include image or video
sequences.
 Extract relevant features from the data, such as hand positions, movements, or
joint angles.
 Train a machine learning model, such as a convolutional neural network (CNN)
or recurrent neural network (RNN), to classify different gestures.
